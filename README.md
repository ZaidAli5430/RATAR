## Motivation
In the times of pandemics such as COVID-19 where social distancing is of utmost importance, companies across the world are trying to adopt new ways of working, keeping in view of social distancing. Thus, our application will help these industries adopt an approach where they could provide assistance regarding their product while
maintaining social distancing.

Furthermore, due to the nature of our app, it can be used for remote training of newly hired technicians as well. Designated training on demand programs can be set in motion through which novice technicians can get expert help from the senior ones’ hence eliminating the need for senior technicians to be on-field.
